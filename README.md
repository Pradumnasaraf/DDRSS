**DDRSS Bot is a user-specific Discord Bot**, which help user to get all bookmarks and the latest bookmark on their discord chat. It also comes with a search feature to find all the bookmarks which match specific keywords.
<br/>

> This Bot works on [`daily.dev`](https://daily.dev/) shareable bookmark URL as source data (which user has to provide by a command).

<br/>

## üë®‚Äçüíª Bot development and existence.

**RSS Feed** returns XML data, which is complicated and cannot use directly in apps and programs other than the website, by using `feedparser` Python packages, I have converted the data in `JSON` format, which is now easily extractable,  and usable in building any kind of Apps and Bot (in our case).

Every time user calls a command, the bot request data from the API `api.daily.dev/rss/a/*****`  (vary user to user) and extract data like username, Blog/Article links, and title, and convert into `JSON` and return those data accordingly in the proper pre-structured message, depending on the command which the user input
