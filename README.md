**DDRSS Bot is a user-specific Discord Bot**, which help user to get all bookmarks and the latest bookmark on their discord chat. It also comes with a search feature to find the bookmarks which match the specific keywords.
<br/>

> Bot works on [`daily.dev`](https://daily.dev/) shareable bookmark URL as source data.

<br/>

## üë®‚Äçüíª Bot development and existence.

**RSS Feed** returns XML data, which is complicated and cannot use directly in apps and programs other than the website, by using `feedparser` -a  Python package, I have converted the return data into `JSON` format, which is now easily extractable, and usable in building any kind of Apps and Bot (in our case).

Every time user calls a command, the bot request data from the API `api.daily.dev/rss/a/*****`  (link vary user to user) and extract data like `username`, `Blog/Article links`, and `title`, and convert into `JSON` and return those data accordingly in the proper pre-structured message, depending on the command which the user input.
