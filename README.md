> This Bot works on [`daily.dev`](https://daily.dev/) bookmark URL as source data (which user has to provide by a command).

## Bot development and existence.

**RSS Feed** returns XML data, which is complicated and cannot use directly into apps and programs other that webiste, by using `feedparser` Python packages, I have converted the data in `JSON` format, which is now easily extractbale,  and usable in building any kind of Apps and Bot (in our case).

Bot is extracting data like username, Blog/Artcile links, and title and return those data accordingly in proper pre-structued message, depedning on the command which thr user input.
