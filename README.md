**DDRSS Bot is a user-specific Discord Bot**, which help user to get all bookmarks and the latest bookmark on their discord chat. It also comes with a search feature to find all the bookmarks which match specific keywords.
<br/>

> This Bot works on [`daily.dev`](https://daily.dev/) bookmark URL as source data (which user has to provide by a command).

<br/>

## üë®‚Äçüíª Bot development and existence.

**RSS Feed** returns XML data, which is complicated and cannot use directly in apps and programs other than the website, by using `feedparser` Python packages, I have converted the data in `JSON` format, which is now easily extractable,  and usable in building any kind of Apps and Bot (in our case).

The bot is extracting data like username, Blog/Article links, and title and return those data accordingly in the proper pre-structured message, depending on the command which the user input

<br/>

## üïπÔ∏è Using the Bot:
